in order to setup the project in your local machine ,you need to update 
`.env` file and make changes to that file.like `database name, port no and database password`.
once they are completed use this command to run it 

`php artisan serve.`

if this doesnt work you might want to create a key if so use this command 

`php artisan key:generate` and then try to run it again.
